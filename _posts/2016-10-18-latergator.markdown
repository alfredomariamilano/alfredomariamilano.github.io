A small app made for a 24-hour hackathon. I teamed up with other 5 to make this travel app using the NomadList API to get information about hotels prices, AirBnB prices, beer prices, coffee prices and the nightlife score for over 700 cities around the world.

<strong>Technology used:</strong> JavaScript, CSS3, Ionic (to deploy the app on iOS devices).
