The app lets the user register and displays random movie posters taken from the “The Movie Database” API, over which the user can swipe left or right to select if they’ve watched it or not. The user has a personal profile in which all the movies are stored, watched or not watched, and can filter them to browse easily to each movie page, that contains images, videos, an overview and other useful infos about the movie.
